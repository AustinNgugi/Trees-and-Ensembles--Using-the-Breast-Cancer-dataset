The feature importance analysis reveals that both models identify similar key features (e.g., mean radius, mean concave points), but the random forest provides a more trustworthy ranking due to its ensemble nature.
This stability is crucial for explaining the model to stakeholders, such as medical professionals, who need confidence in which tumor characteristics drive predictions.
The decision tree’s importance might highlight features due to overfitting (e.g., a less relevant feature in a deep node), whereas the random forest’s consensus approach aligns better with biological relevance.
In terms of performance, the random forest’s higher accuracy (95-97% vs. 90-94%) makes it the better choice for this task. This improvement is not just numerical but practical— in a medical context, a 2-5% accuracy boost could translate to fewer misdiagnosed cases, enhancing patient outcomes. 
The trade-off is computational cost (random forest is slower to train), but for the Breast Cancer dataset’s size, this is negligible.
